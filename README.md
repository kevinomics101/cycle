Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.
The best rides are the ones where you bite off much more than you can chew, and live through it. Cycle is played according to the following rules. Players can move up, down, left and right. Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys. Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys. Each player's trail grows as they move. Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
If a player collides with their opponent's trail the game is over.

## Getting Started

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
